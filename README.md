# Checkpoint

Checkpoint is a website that has been created to facilitate a peer-led support service to veterans dealing with mental health struggles. The blog style of the site allows veterans to share their own experiences and explore different ways of improving their health & wellbeing.
The driving force behind this method of digital story sharing is to enable users to discuss their difficulties transitioning back to civilian life without the attached mental health stigma.
